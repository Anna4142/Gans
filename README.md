# Gan anime face generation
Using GAN architectures to create anime faces.I will experiment with several architectures like DCGAN,StyleGan ,StyleGAN2.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of high resolution 140,000 512x512 images of anime faces which is of about 11GB and can be downloaded here.

## About GANS

GAN, short for Generative Adversarial Network, is a type of deep learning model that can generate new data samples that are similar to a given dataset. GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator learns to produce fake data samples that resemble the real data, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and fake samples. The two networks are trained together in a process called adversarial training, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator and the discriminator tries to correctly identify the fake samples
